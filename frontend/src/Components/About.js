      <p>
        As a Software Development Enthusiast with a recent MCA degree, I am excited to begin my career in the software development industry. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, React.js, and Node.js, I am passionate about coding and problem-solving. My academic journey at D. Y. Patil Institute, where I completed my MCA, along with my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Yashwantrao Chavan Institute, has provided me with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

        I have gained hands-on experience through projects such as the "TravelMate" Android application and the "Ankur Vidyarthi Foundation" NGO website, where I worked on both frontend and backend development. These experiences have enhanced my skills in MySQL, Bootstrap, ReactJS, and NodeJS, and taught me the importance of creating user-centric solutions.

        Dedicated to continuous learning, I have recently completed advanced coursework in React, software testing, and prompt engineering. I am eager to contribute to innovative tech projects and am excited about the opportunity to bring fresh perspectives and enthusiasm to a dynamic team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I look forward to growing professionally, collaborating with experienced developers, and making a meaningful impact in the world of software engineering.
